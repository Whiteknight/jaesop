jsop is JavaScript on Parrot. It is an experimental playground. It probably
does not work, is not the best solution to the problem, and is not stable or
usable. Awesome.

The current architecture for the "stage0" section borrows code from
zaach/cafe. It uses Jison to parse JavaScript with JavaScript to produce an
ast. It transforms that ast into a new tree form called "wast". From there, it
will attempt to output Winxed code.

If this strategy works works well, it will be used as a stage 0 of a
bootstrapped js compiler. The winxed version will be used to parse a stage1,
written in JavaScript. Stage 1 will be used to compile itself for stage 2.

If it does not work, I'll delete it, claim it never happened, and try
something else.
